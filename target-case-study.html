              The information I gathered from the research phase: I conducted a total of 6 interviews, all users ranging between the ages of 15-50. 
              I wanted to gather a very diverse group of users in order to develop a design that can cater to a variety of user types. 
              For this group in particular, I received a good balance of feedback between new and experienced users.

                <p>
                    With all this information gathered, I was able to start brainstorming my ideas through wireframes. 
                    Creating wireframes is a critical step in the development phase of any design, as it serves as a foundation for 
                    the final product (think blueprint). This step helps hyperfocus on the functionality/interface rather than the 
                    aesthetics. Making it pretty would only be the next step.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>My research presented 3 primary user types:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Experienced Users</strong> - Individuals who have been shopping at Target and are familiar with the app.</li>
              <li><strong>Inexperienced Users</strong> - Users who are either new to the app or infrequent Target shoppers.</li>
              <li><strong>Tech-Savvy Users</strong> - While they may be new to Target and the app, they are familiar with similar interfaces and have vast experience with e-commerce platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The tech-savvy user came in handy because they were able to provide me a general idea of what other apps are doing to keep their users engaged and happy. Seeing how they and the inexperienced users navigated the app helped me determine where they expected certain features to be, what seemed out of place, and what actually did work for them.</p>
            <p>With the experienced users, it was interesting to see that there were still some things that they had not been aware existed within the app, indicating that the interface contained hidden features that could be revised to appear more noticeable or easier to access.</p>
            <p>Despite the vast areas of expertise, all users shared common goals and pain points, which sparked the idea for this prototype.</p>
            <h4>Challenges I Faced</h4>
            <p>Figuring out what to do with and how to organize all the information without getting overwhelmed myself was a bit of a task. I didn’t want to take something that was clearly visible in the original design and hide it just for the sake of making something else more visible. I think that implementing a more accurate algorithm will help with the cluttering and prioritize mainly what the user wants to see first.</p>
