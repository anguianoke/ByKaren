          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hidden Features:</strong> Key features are difficult to discover or poorly communicated, leading to missed oppurtunities for deeper engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Confusing Filtering & Categorization:</strong> Users struggle with unclear or inconsistent filtering options, making it difficult to narrow down product results effectively.</li>

            <li><strong>Lack of Personalized Content:</strong> Users expressed dissatisfaction with the generic deals and recommendations, highlighting the need for personalized content that reflects their preferences and shopping habits. Infomartion that was irrelevant to them would reduce their interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Customizable Options:</strong> The app provided limiting opportunities for users to customize their experience and tailor the app to their needs.</li>

      <p>
        To focus my redesign efforts, I synthesized the common user pain points into two core problem areas.
      </p>
    </section>

    <div class="framed-container">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hidden Features</li>
        <li>Confusing Filtering and Categorization</li>
      </ul>
          
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p><strong>Simplify Navigation and Filters:</strong> Redesign the app's menus, layout order, and filtering options to be more intuitive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Group related items together logically</li>
        <li>Use clear labels and visual cues</li>
        <li>Organize to fit industry standards</li>
      </ul>
          
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Reduce cognitive overload, make it easier for users to find what they’re looking for, and encourage deeper engagement with the app through exploration.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="framed-container alt-container">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cluttered layout</li>
        <li>Lack of personalized content</li>
        <li>Limited customization options</li>
      </ul>
          
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p><strong>Streamline Design:</strong> Create a visually appealing and less cluttered interface.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use white space effectively</li>
        <li>Remove repititive information</li>
        <li>Prioritize the display of personalized content</li>
        <li>Add a customizable feature</li>
      </ul>
          
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>A more inviting experience that enhances readability and reduces the sense of overwhelm for users. Additionally, have increased user engagement by fostering a more social and enjoyable atmosphere within the app.</p>
    </div>

    <section class="user-interviews">
      <h2>User Interview Reflections</h2>
      <p class="interview-description">
        <strong>Information I gathered from the research phase:</strong>  
        I conducted a total of 6 interviews, all users ranging between the ages of 15-50. 
        This age range was intentionally broad to ensure I captured a diverse range of perspectives.
      </p>
      <p class="interview-description">
        Through the interviews, I discovered three primary user types:
        <ul class="interview-list">
          <li><strong>Experienced Users</strong> - Regular Target shoppers familiar with the app</li>
          <li><strong>Inexperienced Users</strong> - New or infrequent users with limited app interaction</li>
          <li><strong>Tech-Savvy Users</strong> - New to Target, but highly familiar with other e-commerce apps</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="interview-description">
        Each group contributed unique perspectives:
        <ul class="interview-list">
          <li><strong>Experienced Users</strong> highlighted a surprising insight: even seasoned app users had missed key features — revealing that important tools were hidden or not intuitive in the interface.</li>
          <li><strong>Inexperienced Users</strong> helped identify confusing areas, unclear labels, and features they expected to be in different places.</li>
          <li><strong>Tech-Savvy Users</strong> gave insights into what other apps are doing well, and helped reveal expectations around layout, personalization, and navigation.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="interview-description">
          Despite the vast areas of expertise, all users shared common goals and pain points, which sparked the idea for this prototype.

        <p>
          With all this information gathered, I was able to start brainstorming my ideas through wireframes. 
          reating wireframes is a critical step in the development phase of any design, as it serves as a foundation for 
          the final product (think blueprint). This step helps hyperfocus on the functionality/interface rather than the 
          aesthetics. Making it pretty would only be the next step.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project was a great opportunity to tackle some of the main pain points users had, like hidden features, clutter, and a lack of personalization. By working through wireframes and prototypes, I focused on making the app easier to navigate, more personalized, and cleaner overall. Things like clearer labels and making key tabs easier to access were small but impactful changes.
              Getting feedback from users helped me fine-tune the design and make it more intuitive. Overall, this project really showed me how important it is to keep the user in mind and how small tweaks can make a big difference in the experience.
            </p>
            <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
            <p>Figuring out what to do with and how to organize all the information without getting overwhelmed myself was a bit of a task. I didn't want to take something that was clearly visible in the original design and hide it just for the sake of making something else more visible.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I believe that implementing a more accurate algorithm will help with the cluttering and prioritize mainly what the user wants to see first.</p>
