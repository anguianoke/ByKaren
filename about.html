                <p>Hey, I'm Karen! I'm a UX designer based in North Carolina, and I'm passionate about building intuitive and meaningful experiences through creative design.</p>
                <p>
                  As a self-taught artist, I discovered early on that I loved inspiring others through the things I could design from scratch. But I soon realized that great design isn't always just about aesthetics‚Äîit's about solving real-world problems and making interactions effortless and enjoyable.

            <h2>WHY UX?</h2>
            <p class="about-text">
                My love for design started with simple doodles, which evolved into concept art and eventually blossomed into fashion illustration. I wanted to help startup clothing brands bring their garment ideas to life, which sparked my interest in freelancing for small businesses that wish to make their mark. 
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                Then came <strong>Quarantine</strong> (aka the era of too much free time), and that‚Äôs when I stumbled upon <strong>UX/UI design</strong>‚Äîa world where creativity meets problem-solving, and a perfect mix of everything I wanted to do!
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                Now, I love collaborating with entrepreneurs and startups to turn their ideas into fully functional experiences. For me, the best part is seeing an idea go from a rough sketch to something real‚Äîsomething people can actually use and enjoy.

              Studying Experience Design has deepened my understanding of how people interact with technology and how thoughtful design can shape those interactions. It‚Äôs helped me refine my approach to UX/UI, combining research, usability, and creativity to craft intuitive experiences.

              As a first-generation student, I know how important it is to uplift and create opportunities for underrepresented communities. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm passionate about ensuring that diverse voices are heard‚Äîwhether in design, tech, or everyday life.</p>

              Ramadan is my favorite time of the year! It‚Äôs always a nice reminder to slow down, reflect, and appreciate the little things.</p>
