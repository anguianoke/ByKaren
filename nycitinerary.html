            <p class="case-description">
                This project was born out of a real-life need: planning a 3-day NYC trip for my cousin, a first-time visitor. I wanted to create a resource that was easy to follow, visually pleasing, and tailored to her interests — including some personalized options for food spots, aesthetic spaces, and cultural landmarks.</p>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer and Web Developer</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create an easy-to-follow, 3-day itinerary to provide a fullfilling experience for first-time New York City travlers.</p>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Top-Down — Building this website from scratch reuired me to start with a big picture idea before focusing on the specific content and interactions needed to make it happen</p>

            <p> Because this itinerary started with the intention of creating a seamless trip for my cousin, I took an approach to personalize it to her needs. With this in mind, making sure I understood what she wanted to get out of the trip was important.</p>
            <p> I interviewed my cousin (the user) to understand:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Her dietary restrictions</li>
              <li>Interest in cultural landmarks and aesthetic locations</li>
              <li>Need for easy navigation and clear directions</li>
            </ul>

            <p> I also researched:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Top-rated resteraunts to fit her interests and curiosities</li>
                <li>Used Google Maps to plan eficient routes</li>
                <li>Browsed NYC travel blogs and Reddit for real user insights</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project really made me think like both a traveler and a designer. I wasn’t just building a site — I was imagining what it would feel like to actually use it while walking through NYC, hungry and maybe a little lost. It reminded me how important it is to design with empathy, even for fun or personal projects. Thinking about user context (like phone screens, walking directions, or halal food needs) made the whole experience feel more real and meaningful.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Too Many Options, Not Enough Time</strong> - It took me a lot of brain power to narrow down the multitude of things to do in NYC into a 3-day trip.</li>
              <li><strong>Keeping it Simple</strong> - It was a challenge to avoid clutter while still trying to make it visually interesting.</li>
              <li><strong>Limited Time for Deep User Testing</strong> - Since this was a personal project with one primary user, there was a restriction in gathering diverse feedback. </li>
            </ul>
